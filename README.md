## Why - for businesses?

- Speed of development
- Modern future-proof architecture
- Lots of baked-in features that otherwise get missed
- Less cost

## Why - for me?

- Knowledge and learning
- Having a portfolio project means it's easier to get hired as a contractor
- Can charge a premium contracting rate
- Can potentially charge Consulting level fees (training & solution architecture)
- Base product needs to be Open Source, but a Code Generator could be a paid-for service

## What

- Angular
- NestJS
- PostgresSQL

- JWT authentication (Firebase or cognito)
- Deployment (Google or AWS)


## What Not?

- Mobile - but REST API so you can write your own
- Every other serverless platform (Azure, Heroku etc)  - but it's Docker
