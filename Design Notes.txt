Map Component - Dynamic Behaviours
----------------------------------

* Changing a easting/northing will clear the linked Location
* Changing a easting/northing field will update the Map location (but you may get "ocean" until the numbers are right)
* Shift+Click on the map will clear the linked Location
* Shift+Click will update the easting/northing coordinates
* Selecting a Location will update the easting/northing and the map
* Clearing the Location (click the "Clear" link in the field) will clear the location but won't change the easting/northing or the map
* The "Shift+Click to set coordinates" help text in the bottom left of the map depends on the form being in edit mode and will not appear in view mode.

* You can still create a new "Saved Location" from the Event page without having to leave the Event form edit mode. Once
allocated to the Event it will then follow all the other "Location" entity behaviors outlined above and won't be deleted
if the user abandons their Event data entry.

* In view mode you can still zoom the map with the scroll wheel and drag the map to change location. The pink dot should
never change position even if the Location is updated (in another tab) and you refresh this Event. Event locations are
only updated if you edit the Event after the Location has had the coordinates changed.

* Altitude isn't really used and probably should be made read-only. Ground altitude should be determined from the
easting/northing and doing a GIS lookup. KIMS does not want to model Aerial altitudes.

How to init a functional component. Maybe not ideal since this only runs after the first render, but that may be
necessary if there's a delay fetching data from some sort of async call - should show a loading indicator while
loading.

useEffect(() => {
    // No variable dependencies means this would run only once after the first render
}, []);
