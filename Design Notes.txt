How to init a functional component. Maybe not ideal since this only runs after the first render, but that may be
necessary if there's a delay fetching data from some sort of async call - should show a loading indicator while

npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions


cd client
npm run build:prod
firebase deploy --only hosting
